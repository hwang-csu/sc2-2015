%As mobile devices continue to become increasingly ubiquitous in
%society, the demand for incorporating their use in the healthcare
%industry is concurrently rising.  However, 
The current security models on mobile devices do not provide the level of
protection required to handle sensitive data, such as protected healthcare
information.  In this paper, we introduce a Distributed Android Security
Framework (DASF). DASF is a custom security framework for Android-based mobile
devices that allows the enforcement of dynamic security policies on an
application's privileges and sensitive data.  DASF allows servers to
dynamically impose security policies by using an application-layer message
protocol implemented in the system.  The security policies enforced by DASF
enables system-wide privilege restrictions on untrustworthy applications and
sensitive data.  Ultimately, DASF allows organizations (i.e., data owners) to
dynamically dictate the security policies enforced by the system, and retain
control of the sensitive data they send to the device. We implement a prototype
of DASF on Android \textit{Jellybean}, and perform a security and performance
evaluation. We show the DASF can defeat a number of security threats associated
with using mobile devices in the healthcare industry, and imposes a reasonable
performance overhead.
