As mobile devices continue to become increasingly ubiquitous in
society, the demand for incorporating their use in the healthcare
industry is concurrently rising.  However, the current security
models on mobile devices do not provide the level of
protection that is needed for the devices to handle sensitive
data, such as protected healthcare information.  In this paper, we
introduce a Distributed Android Security Framework (DASF). DASF is
a custom security framework for Android-based mobile devices that
allows dynamic security policies to be enforced on an application's
privileges and sensitive data.  DASF allows a server to dynamically
impose the security policies by utilizing an application-layer
message protocol that is implemented in the system.  The security
policies enforced by DASF will allow for system-wide
privilege restrictions to be enforced on untrustworthy
applications and sensitive data.  Ultimately, DASF
 will allow the organization that issues
the mobile devices to dynamically dictate the security
policies enforced by the system and retain control
of the sensitive data that they send to the device.
