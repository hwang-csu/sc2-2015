\section{Conclusion}

This paper describes a distributed security framework (DASF) for Android-based mobile operating systems designed to provide dynamic  
privilege restrictions on applications and security policies on 
sensitive data sent to the device.  Unlike Android's current security model, DASF allows an application's permissions to be 
restricted dynamically to address
the security concerns of mobile devices being
used in sensitive environments.  Further,
DASF also allows the organization
to remain in control of the sensitive data that it
sends to the mobile device by imposing security
policies on that data.  We implement a
prototype of DASF by creating
a system service to enforce privilege restrictions
on applications, and our experiments show that DASF
addresses the limitations of
Android's current security model while
imposing a reasonable performance overhead.
